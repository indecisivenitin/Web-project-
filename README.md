A fully responsive and animated website
Welcome to my fully responsive and animated website built with a modern front-end tech stack. This project showcases seamless integration of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, enhanced with powerful libraries like GSAP for smooth animations, SwiperJS for sleek touch-enabled sliders, and Locomotive JS for immersive scroll effects. Designed with performance and interactivity in mind, the site adapts fluidly across all screen sizes while delivering an engaging user experience with dynamic transitions and elegant layouts.
